**Instructor:** [Roger Grosse](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse)

**Email:** rgrosse at cs dot toronto dot edu (put CSC2541 in the subject line)

**Lecture:** Friday, 2-4pm, in Bahen 1200

**Office Hours:** Tuesday, 2-4pm, in Pratt 290F (that's the D. L. Pratt Building, not the E. J. Pratt Library!)

### Prerequisites

This course is designed to bring students to the current frontier of knowledge on these methods, so that ideally, their course projects can make a novel contribution. A previous background in machine learning such as CSC411 or ECE521 is strongly recommended. Linear algebra, basic multivariate calculus, basics of working with probability, and programming skills are required.

### Relationship with other courses

Since uncertainty is a central topic in machine learning, it's unsurprising that there are lots of courses at UofT focusing on it. Several departments offer core courses focused on probabilistic machine learning, with varying emphases:

* [CSC412, Probabilistic Learning and Reasoning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/courses/csc412/index.html)
* [STA414, Statistical Methods for Machine Learning](https://duvenaud.github.io/sta414/)
* [ECE521, Inference Algorithms and Machine Learning](https://ece521.github.io/)

Those courses are all lecture-based, and aim to give broad coverage of probabilistic modeling techniques. They focus on principles which are pretty well understood.

By contrast, CSC2541 is a topics course which aims to bring you to the research frontier on certain topics. Many of the topics have not yet been distilled in an easily accessible form, and a lot of the key experimental findings are still open to multiple interpretations. While the core courses listed above cover a variety of techniques, here we focus on a smaller set (mostly Gaussian processes, Bayesian neural nets, and variational inference) and look at how they can be applied in situations that depend on accurate uncertainty modeling.

CSC2541 is a topics course which is offered repeatedly but with different topics. I'm only planning to offer this version of the course once. David Duvenaud recently taught a [version of 2541](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/courses/csc2541/index.html) focused on generative models, and in the winter, he'll be teaching a topics course focused on learning discrete structure. I've tried to minimize the overlap with those courses, so if you've taken 2541 before, you should be able to take it again without being bored. I think there are roughly 2 weeks of overlap with last year's iteration of 2541: variational inference and model-based reinforcement learning.
