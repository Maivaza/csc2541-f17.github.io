**Instructor:** [Roger Grosse](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse)

**Email:** rgrosse at cs dot toronto dot edu (put CSC2541 in the subject line)

**Lecture:** Friday, 2-4pm, in Bahen 1200

**Office Hours:** Tuesday, 2-4pm, in Pratt 290F (that's the D. L. Pratt Building, not the E. J. Pratt Library!)

### Prerequisites

This course is designed to bring students to the current frontier of knowledge on these methods, so that ideally, their course projects can make a novel contribution. A previous background in machine learning such as CSC411 or ECE521 is strongly recommended. Linear algebra, basic multivariate calculus, basics of working with probability, and programming skills are required.

### Topics

The set of topics is still subject to change, but is likely to include:

* **Gaussian processes.** Basic concepts. Design of kernels. Fitting hyperparameters. Sparse approximations.
* **Bayesian neural nets.** Relationship with GPs. Inferring the parameters using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics.
* **Variational inference and description length.** Basics of variational Bayes. Interpretation as description length through the bits-back argument. Variational inducing points for GPs. Natural gradient and stochastic variational inference. Practical variational inference for Bayesian neural nets using the reparameterization trick.
* **Using uncertainty to drive exploration.** Bandits, active learning, Bayesian optimization, and model-based reinforcement learning.
* **Learning preferences.**
* **Adversarial robustness.**
